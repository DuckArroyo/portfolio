      Hello, my name is Rafael Arroyo, and I am a web development student at the University of Oregon. I am starting a YouTube channel in 2022. Love and enjoy the Pacific Northwest #UpperLeftUSA. For the past 6 years I have been playing the game Ingress where I slay the competition.

    <div class="content">
        <p>I am a University of Oregon graduate, class of 2013, with a B.A. of Arts. I have been the Center for Student Involvement Office Coordinator for the past eight years. I manage the logistics for our office which includes Contract drafting. Budget management. Record keeping. Student Supervision. And many other duties.</p>
      <br>
        <p>I became interested in Web Development after I started working on Power Automate to create the department workflows in Microsoft Teams. After a few weeks of research and trial and error I was able to digitize all our processes.  I can say that we have avoided a reduction of work because of this implementation. After seeing the power of web applications, I began research which led me to the Coding bootcamp I am enrolled in. It is week 3 and so far it is a healthy challenge.</p>
      <br>
        <p>I have a bunch of application ideas I would like work on upon completion of the program, exciting stuff really; Save your phone’s location while offline. Inventory system for a rental shop. Personal house inventory. My log, a log that saves notes and collects metadata on the background.</p>

        <strong>Let’s move to Japan!</strong> 
      <br>
        <p>I want to move to Japan once I pay off my student loans.</p>
      <br>
      <strong>But Why Japan?</strong> 
      <br>
        <p>The truth is that it is many things. Just as it is difficult to encapsulate why we each like our favorite color is, trying to encapsulate why I want to move to Japan. Here is an attempt. 
        I will say that I am not going to Japan for the standard cliché of wanting to find myself, find the perfect culture, or become Japanese. Nor to become a scholar in Japanese culture. I just want to experience Japan; while non-Americans seek the American Dream, I am walking away from it. I don’t want a dream, I want to experience the everyday Japanese life with it’s, outdated technology, red tape riddle bureaucracy, ancient customs, and kawaii culture. The latter let's face it, as an adult white-ish male does not discriminate me. Hey, I too want to be a magical girl! 
        The prospect of moving across the world for a dream can seem ridiculous, true. But that is what life is, a ridiculous experience where we each get an opportunity to live the life we want. I am chosing to take a leap because, why not, it is an adventure!<p>
      <br>
      <strong>What about being a foreigner in another country?</strong>
        <p>I have experience as a foreigner in another country, while I am a US Citizen, I am and will always be an immigrant in the United States. So, the sense of not belonging is already present in my life. Even now, an attempt to move back to Mexico would result in the same feeling of being a foreigner. Realistically, my goal to move to Japan is purely selfish; I want to experience something new. I want to enjoy traveling now, not when I am retired.</p>
      <br>
      <strong>What about speaking, reading, and writing in Japanese?</strong> 
        <p>No problem. I am taking Japanese classes and of course a daily regimen of Anime!</p>
      <br>
      <strong>How will you support yourself?</strong> 
        <p>Web development will help quite a bit. Plus, I am working on diversifying my passive income sources with the other skills I have. One option is to become a English teacher, not my prefered option but I am not against it if it will pay the bills.</p>
      <br>
      <strong>What about after?</strong> 
        <p>I am open to all possibilities whether it means coming back to America or just picking another random country. Because why not!</p>
